# Troll game

In this game two players can use trolls to fight each other in a closed world.
This version is the one done during my studies.

## Features

The trolls can move in the world, grab objects (weapons, potions...), equip
objects, hit the other trolls...

## Requirements

The game needs a postgresql database and the jdbc .jar file to use it.

## Future developments

* The code has to be translated in english.
* I also may wish to write it in another language (Python, C or C++ maybe ?)
* And some features don't really work and need to be cleaned up a little...
